Build a responsive, frontend-only website for a fictional AI data startup called SpecifiAI, headquartered in New York City. The company provides legally compliant training datasets to AI developers, especially startups.

The site should simulate a clean, modern B2B SaaS startup experience, and the design must visually match the style and branding used in SpecifiAI‚Äôs pitch deck.
